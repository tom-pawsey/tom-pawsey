Hi, I'm Tom, a Data Analytics Associate at Xander Talent!

I'm currently improving my coding skills, with a particular emphasis on Python, SQL and Tableau.

I'll be creating and updating my projects on here as I go through my data journey.

I'm passionate about the environment, and enjoy watching films, playing sport, and listening to music.

If you want to contact me about anything, you can reach me at tom.pawsey@xandertalent.com, or message me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/tompawseyxander/
