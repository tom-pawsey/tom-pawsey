## Hi, I'm Tom, a Data Analytics Consultant at Xander Talent!

I'm currently improving my coding and analytics skills, with a particular emphasis on Python, SQL and Tableau.

I'll be creating and updating my Python and SQL projects on here as I go through my data journey, while my Tableau dashboards can be found on https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tom4888#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0.

I'm passionate about the environment, and enjoy watching films, playing sport, and listening to music.

If you want to contact me about anything, you can reach me at tom.pawsey@xandertalent.com, or message me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/tompawseyxander/.
